Challenge set by Deep Xavier from Edabit

Write a function that stutters a word as if someone is struggling to read it. 
The first two letters are repeated twice with an ellipsis ... and space after
each, and then the word is pronounced with a question mark ?.
Example
stutter("incredible") ➞ "in... in... incredible?"

stutter("enthusiastic") ➞ "en... en... enthusiastic?"

stutter("outstanding") ➞ "ou... ou... outstanding?"


def stutter(word):
	char1 = word[0]
	char2 = word[1]
	return(char1 + char2 + "... " + char1  +  char2  + "... " + word + "?")
